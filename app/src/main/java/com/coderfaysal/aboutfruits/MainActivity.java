Its fruit varies in appearance and is one of the most important and widely cultivated fruits of the tropical world. \nThe mango is considered indigenous to southern Asia, and mango trees can be found today in Brazil, the West Indies, Florida, and other tropical environments. The mango does not require any particular soil, but the finer varieties yield good crops only where there is a well-defined dry season to stimulate fruit production. \nMango fruits are a rich source of vitamins A, C, and D. There is also research that suggests that mangoes can help control weight, fight cancer, and improve digestion. Mangoes have high sugar content compared with other fruits, however, which may pose risks to some people. \nBecause there are many different varieties that require different growth conditions, mangoes are generally available year-round. However, June and July are considered the best time to buy mangoes in the United States.");

Cavendish, or dessert, bananas are most commonly eaten fresh, though they may be fried or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings. They may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads. Cooking varieties, or plantains, are starchy rather than sweet and are grown extensively as a staple food source in tropical regions; they are cooked when ripe or immature.
